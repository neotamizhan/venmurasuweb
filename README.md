Venmurasu WebApp
================

Its a webapp which gives quick access to venmurasu episodes. 

Initial plan is to use angular to build the app. No database for now. We will rely on a plain json file, and query on that directly using linq.js

If the db becomes too big, then we would make a backend (mongolab).
